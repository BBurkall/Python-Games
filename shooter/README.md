# Shooter Game

This game has been done following a tutorial of Youtube by [Mundo Python](https://www.youtube.com/@MundoPython/playlists)

I've added some features to the game like the ammo limitation, and some vertical movement.

I just wanted to learn the basics of pygame so I could start making more games.

## How to play

- Use the arrows to move
- Use SPACE to shoot. You can only have three bullets on the screen at the same time.
- Avoid meteors
- If you get hit four times by meteors, you lose

To execute the game go inside the directory where the game is found and write:
```python
python .\minesweeper.py
```
