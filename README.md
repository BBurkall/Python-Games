# Minesweeper

This is my first game created using PyGame.

Python installation is required. You can install python downloading the last version in https://www.python.org/downloads/
Also you need the Pygame library. You can install it using pip.
```python
pip install pygame
```
To execute the game write:
```python
python .\minesweeper.py
```
