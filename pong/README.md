# Shooter Game

This is my first game done with pygame.

## How to play

This is a two players game.

- Player 1 uses W and S to move
- Player 2 uses UP KEY and DOWN KEY to move
- Move in order to hit the ball
- Every time a player hits the ball, the ball will go faster. If someone scores, the ball speed will reset.

To execute the game go inside the directory where the game is found and write:
```python
python .\pong.py
```
